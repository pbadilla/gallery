# MyTheresa Carousel V.1.0

## Project by @pachibadilla

### Technology:

- React
- Redux
- Webpack
- Sass
- HTML5

### How to start:

- Clone this repository into your local
- Open command terminal and write `yarn`. It should install all dependencies.
- After the installation you have to write on your console `yarn start`, and
  project should load on port 9000, so on you browser, if not romt automatically you could write:
  `http://localhost:9000` and project should render.

### Items to upgrade: 
- For sure I am not using sass on react projects I use `styled-components` on my point of view, more accurate it.
- `wihslist`is just for session on redux: I didn't see on API TMBD.org any place or command to add `lists` so maybe it could be reconsider this on local BBDD (for example mongodb ) or place on cloud.
